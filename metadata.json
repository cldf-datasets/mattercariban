    "description": "This list contains 2241 lexical entries for 23 Cariban languages. The concepts are based on Meira & Franchetto (2005) (doi:10.1086/491633), with the following modifications: ‘vein’ was removed, as it is usually identical to ‘root’; 'lie', 'sit', and 'stand' were removed, as there are usually no dedicated verbs in Cariban languages.",
